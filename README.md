# CIS 519 Final Project - Advanced Machine Learning
## Music by Genre Synthesizer Comparison
For this project, we study the problem of generating new melodies in three different genres (classical, rock and jazz) based on a training dataset containing melodies belonging to each genre. Two kinds of models were used: an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Neural Network) and a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). Our primary contributions were in application, as neither of the models had been used specifically for this genre-specific purpose, and analysis of the results, which include both subjective and objective metrics.All files and outputs can be seen on our github repository. The best-sounding music produced by our models can be listened to on soundcloud
